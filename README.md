# Auto-macOS-Installers
Automatically formats, partitions, and installs bootable macOS installers to a single USB drive

## How to use
Before doing anything, please ensure you have the macOS installers downloaded and in the directory Applications/macOS Installers

Once you have the macOS installers in the correct location, plug in a USB and run the script. You will need to select your USB drive and the versions of macOS installers to put on it. From there, the script will create a partition and run the createinstallmedia commmand for each version.
